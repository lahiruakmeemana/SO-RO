Ultrasonic based mapping robot

Path planning, mapping, and localization are fundamental requirements of robotics. Here our intention is to address the mapping requirement. A lot of researches are happening in this scenario. This mapping is done by sensors using Laser, TOF, Stereo, and Monocular cameras, Ultrasonic, and Sonar like technologies. The problem with using these sensors are, the high quality and high functional sensors are very expensive. Our goal is to map a closed area such as a tunnel, room with high accuracy and low cost, in an effective manner.

The intended solution is to use ultrasonic-based sensors since they are affordable, easily acquirable, and have a decent accuracy. Accuracy is to be increased using machine learning principles. A map is to be generated using a map building tool.
